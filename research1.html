        <h1>Exploring the Ideal Grocery Shopping Experience</h1>
        <p>This project was a graduate collaberation in which we researched
            consumers feelings and experiences with grocery shoping. Together,

            co-design sessions.

        <h2>Journey Mapping</h2>
        <p>The journey mapping aspect of this research session involved participants
            making a chronological map of their average grocery shopping experience with a variety of
            preselected images relating to grocery. Afterwards, participants were asked
            to describe their map to the group, wich was video recorded and analyzed
            post session. The maps were also anaylized and coded for meaning and patterns.

        <h2>Co-design Session: Build your Ideal Store</h2>
        <p>In thiss session, were given building materials and asked to create a model of their ideal
            grocery store. This allowed us to analyize problem areas of the grocery shopping experience
            and generate potential solutions based on their creations. After the participants finished 
            their models, they were asked to present their store infrony of the other group. These presentations
            were recorded and coded for insights.
