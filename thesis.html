        <h1>First Year Review Thesis Research</h1>
        <p>This is a brief preview of the my current thesis research thread. I am interested in
            posing studying the emergent mutual aid networks that have arisen in response to the
            COVID-19 pandemic. My main research question is "how can designers create mutual aid 
            in mass crises"

        <p style="text-align: center;">Since coming to this program I’ve taken multiple courses with Liz Sanders which have introduced me to practices of research for design.
            I’ve learned practical skills such as conducting co-design sessions and learning how to analyze and code my research into insights.
            Most importantly I’ve learned about the difference of what it means to design with people as opposed to designing for people.

        <p style="text-align: center;">Luckily there are a number of grassroots efforts that have already been working to address this problem.
            There have been a number of mutual aid networks that have arisen in response to the current social and economic issues.
            These networks organize assistance and resources for those in need.

        <p style="text-align: center;">Sociologist Richard James White defines mutual aid that occurs in advanced economies as “a key dimension of community self-help, which considers, those informal activities that are not 
            formally provided by the state and market” and also “where legal goods and services are exchanged for money and gifts, which are unregistered by, or hidden from, the state.
            So, because currently the state is overburdened with need and the market is partially shut down, it is in these times were mutual aid is necessary to meet some of the essential requirements of life.

        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;">In my preliminary research, I have found that there is an underlying framework to the current mutual aid networks that exist.
            They’re generally facilitated online, people are invited through social media and forwarded onto a page (frequently this is just a google doc)  where they can list resources that they’d like to volunteer such as food or transportation.
            Users are also invited to list what their needs are if they have any.
            Afterwards the administrators of the network match people with specific needs to people who volunteer those same specific resources.
