        <h1>Exploring the Ideal Grocery Shopping Experience</h1>
        <p>This project was a graduate collaberation in which we researched
            consumers feelings and experiences with grocery shoping. Together,
            we learned how to conduct a variety of research techniques, including
            qualitative surveys and collaboration with stakeholders through 
            co-design sessions.

        <h2> Work Shop #1: Verbal Interviews</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The initial workshop involved verbal interveiws of hospital staff and former patients.
            During interviews post-it notes with insights were posted and organized into pre-established catagories.

        <h2> Work Shop #2:Patient Room Co-Design</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">In the second workshop, participants were asked questiions and prompted to articulate their ideas by
            drawing and interacting with room blueprints. This format allowed participants to engage spatially
            and to think procedurally about problems in their workflow. The questions asked were based on the catagories
            from workshop #1. Notes were also taken and organized on posterboard.

        <h2> Work Shop #3:Online Survey</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Because of the impact of COVID-19, our group had to pivot away from doing
        in person interviews towards methods which functioned online and remotely. For our third workshop, we
        created a comprehensive survey on Qualtrics. At this stage we began to narrow down our insights into
        potential design solutions. We used this survet to get feedback on potential ideas.</p>

        <h2>Final Design Insights and Suggestions</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">We took our highest meta-ranked ideas an mocked them up into illustration.
        Each idea was sorted based on scope and feasability.</p>

        <h2>Workshop #4: Breif follow-Up</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">After finalizing our design, we reached out to a few of the hospital
        staff in order to see if our insights have remained relevant in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
